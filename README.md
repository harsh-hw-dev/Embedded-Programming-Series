# 🔌 Embedded Programming Series — Arduino + Proteus  

This repository documents my embedded programming work using **Arduino UNO** and **Proteus simulation**.  
Each project includes:

- Arduino source code  
- Exported HEX file  
- Proteus project file  
- Simulation screenshot  
- Short explanation of the circuit  

The goal of this repo is to provide clear, practical examples for anyone learning **microcontrollers, simulation, and basic electronics**.
